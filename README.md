# Table-Extraction-from-PDFs

**What is Tabula?** Tabular is a basic wrapper of tabula-java that allows users to the extraction of the table and converts the PDF file directly into Data frames or CSVs using Python Programming language. The user can also extract tables from PDF and convert them into TSV, CSV, or JSON format files.

Three ways to get the tables from a PDF by just giving it’s directory :

1)	`After extracting tables a folder will be created named “tables” contains every table in an excel file separated.`
2)	`Convert all tables of the PDF file into a single CSV file named "output.csv"`
3)	`Convert all PDFs in a folder into CSV format. ‘pdfs’ folder should exist in the current directory.`
	
If the PDF doesn’t contain any tables the tables folder and "output.csv"  will be empty.
